      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
	Fast-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as large language models (LLMs) have been driving
  ever increasing computing demands in data centers as well as on the edge. While the traditional accelerator architecture
  continues evolving to provide more processing power within a single chip, the chiplet-based heterogeneous architecture
  is becoming a mainstream of chip designs due to these advantages: 1) Significant reduction of design complexity and cost
  due to mixed technologies and shifting away from monolithic chip design; 2) Heterogeneous chiplets can be integrated to
  accommodate the diversified runtime behaviors of AI applications at the chip level, boosting performance as well as increasing
  compute efficiency; 3) Ease of scaling up and scaling out chiplets brings new opportunities to boost compute power at the system level;
  4) Leveraging on the latest technologies, such as integration of optical interconnects via interposer waveguides and laser integration.
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
  However, how to architect, interconnect and package chiplets and orchestrate heterogeneous computing resources is the key
  to success. The current chiplet ecosystem faces a few challenges: 1) Lack of mature unified standards and tools to allow
  different pieces of silicon across vendors to integrate seamlessly through a common interface. 2) How to enable composable
  architecture design for better resource sharing and data coherency. 3) Extended reach of chiplet interconnect with high bandwidth
  and low latency, especially when the chip area gets close to the wafer scale. 4) Software programming model for heterogeneous
  parallelism on chip with optimal power and performance.
	  </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> 
  The 5th International workshop on the High Performance Chiplet and Interconnect Architectures (<strong>HiPChips-2025</strong>) aims
  to bring together the latest research and development from academia and industry communities and foster closer collaboration to
  address the challenges above. This workshop will focus on several key technology areas in chiplet-based architecture design and
  software ecosystem development. Topics will include but not limited to the followings:	      
	  <p>
	      
	  Architecture:
        <li> Emerging computing technologies (such as neuromorphic / in-memory computing, optical and quantum computing) and integration
             with heterogeneous chiplet architecture </li>
        <li> Optical chiplet integration approaches to enable composable microarchitectures </li>
        <li> AI powered chiplet designs and system optimizations </li>
        <li> Best practice of chiplet manufacturing and advanced packaging </li>
	  </p>
	      <p>
	  Software and Ecosystem:
        <li> Hardware software co-designs on chiplet architecture, programming model and optimizations of heterogeneous chiplet systems </li>
        <li> AI workload characterization and scheduling on heterogeneous chiplet systems</li>
        <li> Performance/power optimizations for resource constrained scenarios (edge) </li>
        <li> Chiplet-to-chiplet proprietary/standardized interface such as UCIe, NVLink etc. </li>
